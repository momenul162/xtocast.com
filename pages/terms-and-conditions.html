            <h3 class="section-title-md">About Us</h3>
            <p>
              We provide an online platform as a service that enables individuals and organizations
              to run voting, ticketing, and filing of nomination events. We provide the needed
              confidentiality in the online voting, purchase of ticket process, and filing of
              nomination process.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
              When you agree to these Terms, you are also agreeing to our Privacy Policy which can
              be found here.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">How It Works</h3>
            <p>
              Users of our online platform are “Owners,” “Event Organizers,” and/or “Participants.”
              “Owners” are the individuals or 'Xtocast company' who create the voting setup. Event
              Organizers are individuals or organizations who patronize our company. Organizations
              or individuals who vote by casting ballots (“Ballots”) are “Participants.”
              Participants cast votes via Mobile Money, Visa/MasterCard, and PayPal. ‘The company’
              (Owners) and Event Organizers must sign a Service Agreement for an account/setup.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">License</h3>
            <p>
              Subject to these Terms, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited
              license to access and use our online platform as a service, as agreed and signed by
              both parties on a separate Services Agreement.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Payments Term, Cancellation and Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Payment processing services are provided by Hubtel (https://hubtel.com) in Ghana, and
              the terms and conditions of those services will apply to the payments you make using
              them. Any personal information you provide to these payment providers will be
              processed in accordance with their privacy policies and not ours.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Cancellation</h3>
            <p>
              Fraudulent transactions are immediately cancelled after being detected by our payment
              processing company. To protect Xtocast and its clients against chargeback-related
              issues, any active sale associated with the same fraudulent credit card will also be
              cancelled.
            </p>

            <p>
              You should be aware that receipt of payment to your voting service does not
              necessarily mean that these transactions cannot be reversed. We (our payment
              processing company) reserve the right to reverse a payment in case the payer or the
              payer’s bank or payment service provider has charged back or otherwise reversed (or is
              reasonably likely to chargeback or otherwise reverse) an upload or other payment which
              was used to fund the payment to you. You will have to provide a valid receipt to
              enable us to fight the chargeback and will be notified promptly before such action
              takes place.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Refunds</h3>
            <p>Subject to applicable law:</p>
            <ul class="">
              <li>
                All transactions done on Xtocast are final and any requests for refunds are subject
                to review.
              </li>
              <li>
                Xtocast will not be liable for any damages whatsoever resulting from a wrong
                transaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Xtocast may pass on any costs incurred for conducting a refund to event organizers.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Where required by law, refunds associated with certain transactions may be eligible
              for different treatment.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Right To Refund</h3>
            <p>
              You, the customer, are entitled to request a refund of your payment as a result of
              this agreement if the service being paid for is not received/delivered from Xtocast.
              If you want a refund, you must email via
              <a
                href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"
                class="__cf_email__ breadcrumbs-nav"
                data-cfemail="87fff3e8e4e6f4f3c7e0eae6eeeba9e4e8ea"
                >[email&#160;protected]</a
              >, call, or deliver your written request to Xtocast at our registered office.
            </p>

            <p>
              All refund requests will be dealt with high priority, and once reviewed and approved,
              will be returned back to the original source of payment (e.g., Mobile Money account or
              bank card).
            </p>

            <p>
              Xtocast keeps detailed logs of all transactions that take place. Xtocast will conduct
              a detailed investigation of all refund requests for its services. In cases where it is
              possible to "return" the services already paid, we will endeavor to process a return.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Additional Rights</h3>
            <p>
              Nothing in our refund policy infringes on your rights to contest the decisions of your
              refund request by Xtocast through your payment brand's refund/chargeback process.
            </p>

            <p>
              Xtocast is fully compliant with each of the payment brands' policies. It should be
              noted, however, that by using Xtocast, you are subject to the terms and conditions of
              our service.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Rates</h3>
            <p>
              Our least voting rate is 0.30ps per vote when voting for a nominee of a particular
              category. There can be changes (increment) depending on the event organizer’s
              decisions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title-md">Taxes</h3>
            <p>
              Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any sales or use taxes or duties
              associated with the payment for our Services (collectively, “Taxes”) and must pay
              Xtocast without any reduction for Taxes.
            </p>
